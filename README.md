# CHATTER

Chatter is a simple messaging system which allows you to set a user name and send messages or images to your friends!

This project allows you to create a personalized username to send messages to other connected users. A count in the navigation bar shows how many users are currently connected. Each username is also randomly selected one of four colors, and if no username is selected it will automatically be "Anonymous". When a username is changed, a system message is sent out to all connected users, notifying them of the change. Once you connect the last 5 messages are loaded to your window, allowing you to get up to date with the conversation! Also, if you send a URL of an image of gif, it will automatically be loaded and sent as an image or gif.
